The personal data concerned by this Privacy Policy are therefore all data relating to these Internet users and users, insofar as they are identified or identifiable, for example by means of the IP address of their terminal or their user account identifier. 

The processing of personal data is subject to a specific legal and regulatory framework, consisting for France mainly of the GDPR and the French law known as the "Informatique et Libertés" law of 6 January 1978.

The minor user must obtain the consent of his legal guardian prior to the communication of personal data concerning him. 

## 3. Who is responsible for this processing of personal data, and how to contact him/her?

For any question related to this Privacy Policy, to the processing of personal data implemented by NextMind, and/or to the protection of personal data and privacy by NextMind, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at the following address: dpo (at) next-mind.com. 

## 4. With whom is the data shared? 

The personal data collected and processed as described in article 2 above are only used by authorized and competent persons and services within NextMind. 

We do not transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Union. 

## 5. How long are the data kept?

In particular, when collected for the purposes of managing your Product order, your personal data may be kept for up to 3 years from the end of the commercial relationship.

## 7. Your rights 

In application of the applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data, you have the following rights regarding the processing of your personal data. 

You may exercise them by contacting our Data Protection Officer at the following address: dpo (at) next-mind.com. 

### 7.1. Right of access 

The user may have access to his/her personal data that we process. If requested, we will provide the user with a copy of all his/her personal data and all legally required information, under the conditions provided for by law. 

### 7.2. Right to portability 

For those of the processing operations listed in article 2 above, which have as a legal basis the consent of the user or their necessity for the execution of a contract, the user also has the right to the portability of his/her personal data. 

This right differs from the right of access to personal data insofar as (i) it concerns only the data provided by the user to NextMind and (ii) it allows to obtain this data in a structured and machine-readable format. 

The right to the portability of the user's personal data also opens up the possibility that they may be passed on to another data controller, at the user's discretion, provided that this is technically possible. 

### 7.3. Right of rectification 

The user may ask to correct his/her personal data if it proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or obsolete. 

### 7.4. Right to erasure 

Users may request that their personal data be deleted in the following cases: 
- if their personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or are processed ; 
- if the user has withdrawn his/her consent to the processing of his/her personal data, provided that his/her prior consent has been the legal basis for their collection and processing and that there is no other legal basis justifying them ; 
- if the user has objected to the collection or processing of their personal data in accordance with Article 7.5 below; 
- the processing of the user's personal data is illegal ; 
- the user's personal data must be deleted in order for us to comply with a legal obligation imposed on the user; or 
- if the user was a minor at the time of collection of his/her personal data. In the latter case and provided that the user was a minor at the time of the request, the holders of the user's parental authority may also submit a request to us for the deletion of his/her personal data. 

### 7.5. Right of opposition 

Subject to a legitimate justification based on the particularity of his/her situation, the user may object to any processing of his/her personal data when his/her personal data is processed on the basis that such processing is necessary for the performance of a mission of public interest or the pursuit of our legitimate interest or that of a third party. 

The user can also always oppose, without obligation of reason, the processing of his/her personal data when it is used for purposes of prospecting. 

### 7.6. Right to limitation of processing 

The user may request the limitation of the processing of his/her personal data in the following cases: 
- in case he would contest the accuracy of his/her personal data, and this for the time necessary for NextMind to verify it ; 
- if the processing of his/her personal data is unlawful and the user wishes to limit it rather than request its deletion ; 
- if the user wishes us to retain his/her personal data when it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of his/her rights in court; or 
- if the user has objected to the processing of his/her personal data, for the period during which we verify that we have no other overriding legitimate reasons for further processing. 

- We would then stop processing the data concerned and retain it for the appropriate period of time. 

### 7.7. Right to define directives relating to the fate of data after his/her death 

The user can provide us with instructions on how to store, erase and disclose his/her personal data after his death. 

### 7.8. Right to withdraw consent 

For all processing activities, among those listed in Article 2 above, which have the user's consent as a legal basis, the user has the right to withdraw this consent at any time, without having to justify it. 

### 7.9. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority 

Finally, the user has the right to lodge a complaint relating to the processing activities that we carry out with the competent supervisory authority. 

For France, this control authority is the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés. For more information on the latter and how to contact it, the user is invited to consult the website www.cnil.fr. 

## 8. SECURITY MEASURES 

We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect ourselves against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data we collect, depending on the categories of personal data and the applicable processing activity, such as pseudonymization, encryption of transmitted and stored data, restriction of access by two-factor authentication where applicable.

A dialog box will prompt you to connect the NextMind Sensor.

##### Step 2: Adjust the Sensor

Once connected, you will be guided in the Headset assembly. Then you will see a diagram of the NextMind Sensor electrodes to adjust them for a good quality signal. Try to make sure that most of the dots are green.

##### Step 3: Calibrate

Once the Sensor is properly connected, you will be asked to calibrate the device. Follow the on-screen instructions.

<blockquote class="note-block">The calibration requires you to focus on an object for a period of time (around 30s). 
Upon completion, the NextMind Engine will provide you with a score between <strong>1</strong> (weak) and <strong>5</strong> (excellent). If you score is too low, you may need to repeat the calibration step in order for the app to let you move on to the real-time experience.</blockquote>
